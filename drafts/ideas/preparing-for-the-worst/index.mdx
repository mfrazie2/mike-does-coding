title: Preparing for the Worst
---

In March 2023, I was laid off from my position during a round of downsizing. I was shocked, disappointed and, truthfully, angry; it had nothing to do with performance or responsibilities. The budget could not afford to keep me on staff. After several days of reflection, I stepped away from taking the lay off personally and recognized how fortunate I was to work on a product and engineering team who assisted me in leveling up significantly (in a short tenure).

Since starting in the tech world seven years ago, I have made a habit of providing mentorship to newer engineers (and helping my peers level up with pair programing and knowledge shares).

During review cycles, I would always look through my chicken scratch notes, pull requests, Slack discussions and calendar invites. My lists of accomplishments were few and far between. I could not create a cohesive story of what I did for the last three or six months. Asking my teammates might have netted me a couple of forgotten improvements but it is unfair to off-load my recollection to my peers.

The advice I have given all of my mentees is to keep a weekly/monthly/quarterly record of their accomplishments and growth. During the review cycle, a record of what has been completed is much easier to wittle down than creating a list from nothing (or fragmented sources). Another benefit of maintaining a journal is finding patterns in projects or technologies one works with.

For the longest time I resisted taking my own advice. In my most recent role, I set up a weekly calendar event on Friday afternoons to reflect on what I did the past week. Sometimes the entries were short; other times, they would be quite long. The entries would not be highly detailed, just a few bullets to describe the gist of what I did. Here is an example of what I recorded.

```
- Bug fixes
    - DOB drop down extends 90 years into future, not past
    - Add required authentication hook to account sub-pages
- Add Fullstory SDK to mobile application
    - Start on programmatic way to mask/unmask content
- Led knowledge transfer on custom event tracking
- Led end of sprint retro
```

Within a given week, I might touch multiple platforms and disparate areas of code. Seeing how many times I jump between different contexts can also help me start a conversation with my manager about protecting my "focus time". On the other hand, I am able to see how much I can get done within a week. If there are any threads I am leaving unfinished on Friday, a TODO list at the top of document aids in resetting the context after the weekend.
