title: Array Methods - Filter
---

If you have worked with a large dataset filled with some items you need and other you don't, you've probably needed to use a filter of some kind. A filter allows you to test each item and save only the items that pass the test. JavaScript arrays have a native method, [`Array.prototype.filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter), that can be used in such instances. In this post, we'll explore how we can emulate the native `filter` method using the [`looper`](/blog/array-methods-foreach/) function previously created.

If you haven't read the post on Array Methods - ForEach, I encourage you to read that before continuing.

## Looper

As a refresher, here is the `looper` function we'll build upon to create a `filter` function.

```javascript
let looper = function (array, callback) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    callback(array[i]);
  }
};
```

## Native Filter

The native `filter` method is similar to the native `map` method on arrays. The method acts upon the array that calls it and returns a new array with the values that pass the predicate function. Let's look at an example before creating our own.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

function isOdd(num) {
  return num % 2 > 0;
}

let results = arr.filter(isOdd);
console.log(results); // [1,3,5,7,9]
```

Important to note: if there are no values that pass the predicate function, then an empty array is returned.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

function isZero(num) {
  return num === 0;
}

let results = arr.filter(isZero);
console.log(results); // []
```

Also important to note: the predicate function, `isOdd` and `isZero`, returns a `boolean` value. If the value returned is `true`, we keep the item in the array, otherwise, we skip it and move on.

## Creating a Filter

Now that we have an understanding of how the native `filter` method operates, we are ready to create our own. One thing I like to do when working with new concepts is to identify patterns. The use cases of `Array.prototype.filter` and `Array.prototype.map` look very similiar. Both take a function as an argument and return a new array with the values from that function. Let's look at the [`mapper`](/blog/array-methods-map/) function previously create for clues about how to implement `filter`.

```javascript
function mapper(array, callback) {
  let results = [];
  looper(array, function (item) {
    let value = callback(item);
    results.push(value);
  });
  return results;
}
```

The call signatures of our `filter` and `mapper` will likely be the same. Both functions return an array, so we can keep the `results = []` line. It is the logic inside `looper` that will be different.

```javascript
let filter = function (array, predicate) {
  let results = [];
  looper(array /* ? */);
  return results;
};
```

Remember that the function passed to `looper` runs on every single element of the array. Therefore, we need to figure out how we can invoke the `predicate` function inside of `looper` and only save the values that pass. Look again at the `mapper` function above. Our solution will be very similar. Let's create some pseudo-code to have a plan.

```javascript
// ...
looper(array, function (item) {
  // invoke predicate function with item
  // if predicate is true
  // add item to results array
  // else do nothing
});
// ...
```

This should give us a good idea of what the `callback` should do in the `looper`. Let's make real code.

```javascript
let filter = function (array, predicate) {
  let results = [];
  looper(array, function (item) {
    if (predicate(item)) {
      results.push(item);
    }
  });
  return results;
};
```

That's it! We can now filter an array on any sort of property we want. Just like we did for `map`, let's look at how `filter` builds up the results array.

## Filter in Action

We will use the `isOdd` example from above. Here is how we might call `filter`.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

function isOdd(num) {
  return num % 2 > 0;
}

let results = filter(arr, isOdd);
console.log(results); // [1,3,5,7,9]
```

Here are some key values while iterating over the array.

|   `i`   | `array[i]` | `isOdd(item)` |  `results`  |
| :-----: | :--------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| initial |            |               |     []      |
|    0    |     1      |     true      |     [1]     |
|    1    |     2      |     false     |     [1]     |
|    2    |     3      |     true      |    [1,3]    |
|    3    |     4      |     false     |    [1,3]    |
|    4    |     5      |     true      |   [1,3,5]   |
|    5    |     6      |     false     |   [1,3,5]   |
|    6    |     7      |     true      |  [1,3,5,7]  |
|    7    |     8      |     false     |  [1,3,5,7]  |
|    8    |     9      |     true      | [1,3,5,7,9] |
|    9    |     10     |     false     | [1,3,5,7,9] |

We can see that as the array is iterated over and each value is passed the `predicate` function (`isOdd`), only the values that pass as true are put into the results array.

## Final Thoughts

The native `filter` method is a very helpful tool when working with large datasets or datasets you otherwise need pared down fo ease of use. Knowing how the `predicate` function is used behind the scenes will help you to write your own and to debug the problem when things are not working as you expect.

If you made it this far and are ready for more, you'll appreciate the next post on `Array.prototype.reduce`. This was definitely the most difficult one for me to grasp and I'm looking forward to sharing how I learned to love to `reduce`.
