title: ngShow Directive
---

On a recent project, my team and I implemented a web forum to persist questions and resources that can be lost in a very active Slack community. In the forum, users can ask questions, respond with comments, and vote on comments. An additional feature we included was a snapshot of questions from Stackoverflow related to a specific topic. The Stackoverflow API would return upwards of 30 questions which extends the length of the page quite a bit. To keep the page at a manageable length on load, I incorporated show and hide buttons that manipulate an AngularJS model and the `ngShow` directive.

`ngShow` is a directive that shows or hides HTML elements based on the expression passed to the directive. Here is an example:

```html
<div ng-show="3 > 2">
  <p>This will be visible because 3 > 2 evaluates to true.</p>
</div>
<div ng-show="3 < 2">
  <p>This will not be visible because 3 < 2 evaluates to false.</p>
</div>
```

The `div` tag with a true expression will be visible on the page, whereas the tag with a false expression will be hidden. The expression can be more complex but serves the purpose of understanding how the expression evaluates.

Additionally, the `ngShow` directive can be used with models set on the `$scope`. Check out the code block below.

```html
<div ng-show="truthy">
  <p>This will be visible because "$scope.truthy" evaluates to true.</p>
</div>
<div ng-show="falsy">
  <p>This will not be visible because "$scope.falsy" evaluates to false.</p>
</div>
```

The accompanying JavaScript files contains the following:

```javascript
// …
$scope.truthy = true;
$scope.falsy = false;
// …
```

When the page renders, the models are passed to the expression. Because `$scope.truthy` is set to `true`, that `div` renders to the page.

Lastly, click events on the page can be used to change the boolean value of a model, thereby changing what is rendered to the client.

```html
<div ng-model="showList">
  <a ng-click="showList = true"> Show </a> |
  <a ng-click="showList = false"> Hide </a>
  <ul ng-show="showList">
    <li>This will not visible until `show` is clicked.</li>
    <li>This will go away when `hide` is clicked.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

The `div` wrapper tag is given a `model` called `showList`. The `a` tags contain two click events: one event sets `showList` to `true`, while the other sets it to `false`. The `ul` tag has the `ng-show` directive which evaluates the `showList` model. When the page first renders, `showList` is initially set to a falsy value. When the `Show` tag is pressed, `showList` is assigned `true` and the list appears. When `Hide` is pressed, `showList` is assigned false and the list disappears.

This is a quick and easy method to hide elements on your page using the `ngShow` directive provided by AngularJS. Please visit [ngShow Demo](http://codepen.io/mfrazier/full/eZJQyJ/) for an interactive page and to examine the code in greater detail.
