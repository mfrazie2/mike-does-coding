title: Integer Increments and Decrements

In Javascript, often times a variable assigned a number needs to be incremented or decremented to keep track of a counter or to iterate through an array. There are several ways that a variable can be changed by a value. With such options it can be difficult to know when each option should be used.

```javascript
// Method 1
var i = 1;
i = i + 1;
console.log(i); // >> 2
```

After Method 1 resolves, it is not surprising to find that `i` is equal to 2. A console log of `i` proves that. This is an intuitive method to increase the value of `i` by a some number. The method reads like a math equation and clearly demonstrates the intent of the expression.

```javascript
// Method 2
var j = 1;
j += 1;
console.log(j); // >> 2
```

Method 2 is also fairly intuitive. This is a shorthand version of Method 1 and accomplish the same increment. Additionally, the `-`, `*`, and `/` operators can also be used in the same way as the `+` operator.

```javascript
//Method 3
var k = 1;
k++;
console.log(k); // >> 1
```

This is unexpected. Why does `k` resolve to 1 after being acted upon by the `++` operation? The reason that `k` resolves to 1 after the `++` is because the current state of `k` is held onto before it is incremented. The current state of `k` is returned and then `k` is set to its new value. This causes `k` to only resolve to its incremented value after its current state has been used.

```javascript
//Method 3
var k = 1;
k++;
console.log(k); // >> 1
console.log(k); // >> 2
```

Method 3 shows up often in for-loops iterating over arrays.

```javascript
for (var k = 0; k < myArray.length; k++) {
  console.log(myArray[k]);
}
```

When the conditions of the for-loop are set on the first iteration, `k` will remain equal to 0 until the code block is finished. When the conditions of the for-loop are set for the second iteration, the new value of `k` is used and is equal to 1.

```javascript
// Method 4
var m = 1;
++m;
console.log(m); // >> 2
```

Method 4 looks strikingly similar to Method 3. Both use the `++` operator , but have them positioned on opposite sides of the variable. In Method 4, `m` is incremented first, and then its state is returned. This causes `m` to immediately resolve to its incremented value. Additionally, Methods 3 and 4 can be used with the `--` operator, following the same pattern as above.

The effects of Method 3 and 4 may be more easily seen in an example.

```javascript
// Method 3
var x = 1;
var y = x++;

console.log(y); // >> 1
console.log(x); // >> 2
```

Here, `y` is assigned to the initial value of `x` and then `x` is incremented. Therefore, `y` is assigned the value of 1 and `x` increments and resolves to 2.

```javascript
// Method 4
var w = 1;
var z = ++w;

console.log(w); // >> 2
console.log(z); // >> 2
```

In this case, `w` is incremented first and resolves to 2. Variable `z` is then assigned the value of `w`, which is 2.

Each method has its place in JavaScript. As a developer, you must choose the method that makes the most sense to you and to anyone, including yourself, that may look at your code down the line.
