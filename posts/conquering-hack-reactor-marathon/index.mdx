title: Conquering Hack Reactor's Junior Marathon
---

I was an educator for several years. I taught chemistry and physical science. Both disciplines typically provoked questions and complaints from students about how chemistry, physics, science is applicable to their lives. Each year, it was the same struggle: How to get students excited and on-board with learning not only a new collection of facts, but a way to think, to approach, to confront novel problems.

I would attempt to elicit buy-in from students by saying it was us against the textbook. My goal was to help the students learn chemistry. Their goal was to crack the textbook and make it spill its secrets.

I wasn't a very good salesman. I wasn’t adept at scoping and managing expectations. Not for the students, nor for myself.

When I started in the HRR program, I felt confident in my skills with certain aspects of JavaScript programming. After a few sprints, my confidence was shaken when I recognized I was not finishing with 100% comprehension. Thoughts of being an imposter creeped into my mind. I knew I was not an imposter; I was a novice. My skills were just developing and I had yet to hone my critical thinking skills for programming challenges. I was able to push away these thoughts after having a discussion with Doug.

Doug is a co-founder of Hack Reactor and was at the Chicago Remote Community. When I discussed my concerns with him, he gave me the following advice.

`It is unlikely you can achieve a 100% takeaway on your first time through a sprint. If you feel you have taken away 20%, call it a win. You will only have to work with that framework, library, etc. four more times to be 100% comfortable.`

Luckily, I had this discussion with Doug early on in the program. It helped me manage my expectations of what I could do. I believed I failed a sprint if I could not speak fluently about the problem, algorithm, framework, or library after a two-day exposure. It is unrealistic to expect a robust and deep understanding of NodeJS following the first server-side sprint.

HRR is not an easy program; it is a rewarding program. Your mental health will be saved if you focus on the small victories during the sprints. Seeing the response data from you first `GET` request is an amazing victory; you just communicated with a server! Recall what you knew before you started the sprint. Compare it to what you know you now. You will be astounded with what you will learn in two days. (Revisit this post at the end of Week 6.)

You may find yourself feeling like an imposter at some point during the program. I did not feel confident in calling myself a full-stack JS engineer. I was a jack of many trades (libraries, frameworks), but master of none. While this feeling was not unfounded, it was misguided. Being a full-stack engineer is not about being an expert in all aspects of the stack. It is about having the problem-solving skills to be able to work on a new codebase, a new framework, new library, without needing your hand held through the project. The sprints are set up to support you in developing autonomy so you can succeed in your life after Hack Reactor.

You won’t just survive the sprints. You won’t overcome the sprints. You will conquer them. Like Bane does to Batman, you will snap Backbone JS! The sprints can’t break you but you can break the sprints.
