title: Cycles in Linked Lists
---

In a recent whiteboarding practice session, my partner asked me to write a function that determines if a singly-linked list contains a cycle. Each node in the list has a `data` property holding a number and a `next` property that references the following node in the list. All of the `data` values will be unique numbers.

In a linear linked list, the `next` properties continue to point to the next node until the final node, which references `undefined` as its `next` value. In a cycle, the `next` property points back to a previous node in the list, anywhere in the list. So, how can we determine if a cycle exists in our list?

To start off this problem, my partner and I discussed the major differences between a linear linked list and list with a cycle. We drew a diagram to represent the two types. To further clarify the expected output, I proposed a function that traverses a list and logs the `data` value. For a linear list, we would expect non-repeating values. In a cycle, we would expect something like `8 9 7 6 5 7 6 5 7 6 5 7 6 5 ...`.

In a cycle, the `next` property will always be truthy because the nodes point in a circle. At some point while traversing the list, the same `data` value will be encountered. Because all `data` values are unique, once a non-unique value is encountered the existence of a cycle is confirmed. The second `7` is the start of the cycle. To keep track of the unique values, we could use a hash table or JavaScript object. There is a chance that the provided head node will be in a linear list, so we need to make sure that we take that into consideration. If `node.next` is falsy, then we know the list does not contain a cycle.

Let's take a look at some pseudocode.

```javascript
// declare function that takes in a head node of a linked list
// create a storage hash table to hold unique data values
// iterate over the linked list while node.next exists
// if node.data exists
// return true
// add node.data to storage table
// set node to node.next
// traversal complete, return false
```

Transformed into code:

```javascript
function containsCycle(node) {
  var uniqueVals = {};
  while (node.next) {
    if (uniqueVals[node.data]) {
      return true;
    }
    uniqueVals[node.data] = true;
    node = node.next;
  }
  return false;
}
```

This was a challenging problem at the start because I did not have a solid mental model of a cycle in a linked list. After working through diagrams and expected outputs for a linear versus cycle list, I was better able to approach the problem.
