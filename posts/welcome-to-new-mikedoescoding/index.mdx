This has been a long time coming. I started working a new version of my blog about three years ago. The initial commit for this project was in April 2021. Although, I think I have another version started on a different computer that I never pushed to Github.

I started a blog back in 2016 while I was attending [Hack Reactor Remote](https://www.hackreactor.com/). I tried Medium and wasn't a huge fan of the editor at the time. Things may have changed since then. I chose a project based off a [Jekyll boilerplate](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) because I didn't want to write up my own system. Then, [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) came along. Thank, goodness. There are myriad sources available for getting started. I chose this [course](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-developer-blog-with-gatsby-bd96) on [egghead](https://egghead.io) to get the basics down. For additional changes, I consulted the GatsbyJS [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs), which are fantastic.

### Why I Chose GatsbyJS

I am a JavaScript developer. Being able to write my blog in mostly JavaScript is a huge benefit and my familiarity with React has made the creation of different components much easier. I also wanted a little bit of exposure to [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). I had heard a lot about it in recent years, attended some meet-ups on the subject, but have had no priority to learn it.

### Conclusion: Welcome

At any rate, I welcome you to the new [Mike Does Coding](/). This is still a work in progress and I'm certain many more changes will be coming in the next months. I look forward to sharing my learnings with you along the way. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:me@mikedoescoding.com) with any questions.
